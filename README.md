## Convex Optimisation References
There are many great books to suggest. The ones below are all excellent, and these are the books I used most for preparing these notes.
- [Convex Optimization](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe,  (Cambridge U. Press, 2004; available online at Boyd's website)
	- A popular (and rightly so) introduction to convex optimization, with many examples. This is a great source to get ideas on how to prove that your function is convex (follow the examples and exercises)
- [Numerical Optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-40065-5) by J. Nocedal and S. Wright (Springer, 2005; available online via SpringerLink)
	- This is a comprehensive review of numerical methods; very practical, and most useful when you are implementing a method
- [First-Order Methods in Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997) by Amir Beck, (SIAM, 2017; available online via SIAM eBooks)
	- A recent book that is algorithmic in focus, but includes many results that are not in standard algorithmic books (e.g., the results were previously only in Bauschke and Combettes)
	- Do not confuse this with Amir Beck's other recent book, [Intro to Nonlinear Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611973655) (SIAM, 2014)
- [Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-48311-5) by H. Bauschke and P. Combettes (Springer, 2nd ed 2017; available online via SpringerLink)
	- A nearly comprehensive set of results on convex analysis, superceding Rockafellar's 1970 [Convex Analysis](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr025-ConvexAnalysis.djvu), and overlapping some with Rockafellar and Wets' 1997/2009 [Variational Analysis](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr169-VarAnalysis-RockWets.pdf)
